# Slide-seq co-occurance data

Load in the co-occurance array and intervals from the squidpy cooccurance analysis of the Slide-seq data.
Then, subsequently process and plot using R and ggplot2.

```{r}

occ <- readRDS(file = "/Users/brendan/Desktop/PostDoc/work/HuBMAP/repos/multiscale_celltype_colocalization_analysis/data/slideseq/slideseq.puck190926_08.rctd.co_occurance_array.rds")
occ[1,,]

```

```{r}

intervals <- readRDS(file = "/Users/brendan/Desktop/PostDoc/work/HuBMAP/repos/multiscale_celltype_colocalization_analysis/data/slideseq/slideseq.puck190926_08.rctd.co_occurance_intervals.rds")
intervals

```

# seqFISH co-occurance data

note that the original seqFISH data in squidpy is in a difference scale, so might need to multiply intervals by 1000 to convert to micron scale

```{r}



```
