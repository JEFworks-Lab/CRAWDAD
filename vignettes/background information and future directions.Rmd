outstanding questions:

why the zigzagging pattern at more localized resolutions?

is there a relationship between the transition/inflection point of when a trend passeds the x-axis and goes from pos/neg vis versa, and the size or shape of the pattern it represents?

is there a finite number of trend "shapes" (trend clusters). Do these correspond to specific types of co-localization patterns?



things to include in functions and vignettes:
- can we identify trends that are the "same" for a given cell type colocalization across patients or samples?
- can we identify trends that are "different"?
- identify trends across samples, and then test if sample trends are significantly different. Would indicate that the cell type organization is different between samples (disease vs healthy, young vs age, etc)
- 


joint meeting presentation:
- motivation for cell type organizational patterns. can we quantify? If so, we can start testing known relationships, and then find new ones
- and also test for differences between samples or patients
- simulation to demonstrate and introduce trends
- pairwise, and the transition
- triplets
- then real example with codex
- background on codex
- qualitative observation
- can we identify it?
- show trends, emphasize the subset analysis
- can we find this across samples?
- can we find other trends?
- do have a collection of different trend types I see
- any significant differences?

- then next steps and outstanding questions. Something I am not considering?
