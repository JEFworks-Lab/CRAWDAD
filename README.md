# Multi-scale Cell-type Co-localization Analysis

## Project goals
- formalize computational approach to characterize cell-type co-localizations
- identify cell-type pairs, triplets,etc that are significantly co-localized 
- characterize molecular or other feature differences between co-localized vs non-co-localized cells of a particular cell-type
- enable user-friendly application to new datasets
