# Multi-scale Cell-type Co-localization Analysis

## Project goals
- formalize computational approach to characterize cell-type co-localizations
- identify cell-type pairs, triplets,etc that are significantly co-localized 
- characterize molecular or other feature differences between co-localized vs non-co-localized cells of a particular cell-type
- enable user-friendly application to new datasets


## GitHub branch structure and files

branches:
- `brendan`
- `devel`
- `master` (default)

All branches have the following directories:
- data
- man
- R
- vignettes

Idea is that `master` (default) will eventually be submitted to `bioconductor`. They are strict in terms of the files and folders that can be included.
